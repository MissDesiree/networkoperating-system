The history of Windows Server has been defined by important milestones that have changed the way businesses use computers. It all started with Windows NT 3.1, which introduced a new, more powerful way for computers to work. This set the standard for both regular computers and server systems. Each new version of Windows Server has added better ways for computers to connect to each other, stay safe, and be managed. These improvements have made it easier for businesses to do their work and handle a lot of information and complex networks. This paper looks at the important changes in Windows Server over time and compares it to a popular type of Linux called Debian. It shows how each one is useful in different situations.
Windows NT 3.1 was really important because it used a 32-bit design, which made it faster and more efficient than the older 16-bit systems. According to an article, “Microsoft released its Windows NT operating system in two formats: one for workstations and the other for servers. The 32-bit operating system featured a hardware abstraction layer, which provided more system stability by blocking applications from direct access to system hardware” (Walat, 2017). Because of this upgrade, the system became more stable and handled hardware more efficiently, making it a good choice for both regular users and big companies. This was a big deal for businesses because it meant that servers could handle lots of tasks and big chunks of data without slowing down. 
Later versions, like Windows NT 3.5 and NT 4.0, continued to add new functions. They supported Windows 95 clients and had Internet Information Services (IIS) to compete with UNIX-based systems. Windows NT 3.5, which came out in 1994, brought some improvements, like better performance, improved network abilities, and support for a wider range of hardware. One important feature was the NTFS (New Technology File System), which offered advanced file system features like file-level security, compression, and auditing.
In 1996, Windows NT 4.0 was a big step for Windows Server. It had a new look like Windows 95, so people who used Windows 95 found it easier to use. According to an article, “Internet Information Server (IIS) is Microsoft’s Web server system, which today is the leading Web server software globally, with Apache HTTP Server as a close rival” (Cooper, 2023). IIS is a popular web server system used around the world to deliver web pages to users when they visit a website. It supports many web technologies and services, making it very flexible and widely used. It competes with another popular web server software called Apache HTTP Server. Because of its strong functions and its ability to work well with other Microsoft products, many organizations choose IIS to help them create and manage their websites effectively.
At the start of the 2000s, the Windows 2000 Server was released, and a big improvement was called Active Directory. This changed how network resources, users, and permissions were managed by providing a centralized and standard system. It made it easier for administrators to manage large and complex networks by creating a hierarchical structure. Active Directory also included Group Policy, allowing administrators to enforce specific settings across all computers in the network to ensure consistency and compliance with organizational rules.
Later versions, like Windows Server 2003 and 2008, and their R2 updates kept adding new functions. They made improvements in security, virtualization (with something called Hyper-V), and management tools like Server Manager. When Windows Server 2012 came out, it focused on working with the cloud and made itself into a “Cloud OS” with better virtualization and storage management. The 2012 R2 update kept this up, adding even more security, virtualization, and storage features.
When you look at Windows Server and a popular Linux version like Debian, you can see that they have both differences and similarities. These show us when each one is best to use. Windows Server is a type of operating system that is easy to use if you’re already familiar with Windows. It works on computers with x86-64 architecture and works well with other Microsoft products. On the other hand, Debian is based on the Linux system, which is known for being secure and reliable. It can run on different types of computers, like those with x86, ARM, and MIPS architecture.
When it comes to managing software, Windows Server uses Windows Installer and OneGet. Debian uses dpkg and APT for software installation and updates. In terms of virtualization, Windows Server uses Hyper-V and supports Docker containers. Debian uses tools like KVM, Xen, and Docker for virtualization. For security, Windows Server has functions like Windows Defender and Active Directory integration. Debian is also known for its strong security and provides timely updates through its package management system. Lastly, Windows Server can be expensive, but it comes with extensive support. Debian, on the other hand, is free under the General Public License, making it a cost-effective choice for users on a budget. According to an article, “There is no consortium membership or payment required to participate in its distribution and development. All packages that are formally part of Debian GNU/Linux are free to redistribute, usually under terms specified by the GNU General Public License” (Debian.org, n.d). You can join and help distribute and improve Debian GNU/Linux without having to be part of any specific group or paying any fees. All the software included in Debian GNU/Linux can be freely shared with others, typically under the rules of the GNU General Public License.
In 2016, Microsoft made its cloud-focused strategy stronger with Windows Server 2016. They added new features like support for Docker containers and improvements to software-defined networking. They also introduced Nano Server as a minimal deployment option for better security and launched Hyper-V shielded VMs for data encryption. There were two editions, Standard and Datacenter, with the Standard edition missing some advanced virtualization, storage, and networking features. In 2017, Microsoft divided Windows Server into the Semi-Annual Channel (SAC) for quick DevOps updates and the Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) for more stable updates. The first SAC release, Windows Server version 1709, added support for Linux containers and redesigned Nano Server as a container-based OS. SAC releases were available through Software Assurance or cloud services.
Windows Server has been continuously improving since it introduced the 32-bit architecture in Windows NT 3.1. The latest version, Windows Server 2012, is optimized for the cloud. It offers powerful tools for virtualization, security, and system management, making it a popular choice for businesses. On the other hand, Debian is an open-source operating system known for its strong security features. It's a great option for those looking for cost-effective and flexible solutions. While Windows Server is known for its simplicity of use and smooth incorporation with Microsoft products, Debian stands out for its customization options and the support it gets from a global community. Both operating systems cater to different needs and preferences in enterprise computing.
